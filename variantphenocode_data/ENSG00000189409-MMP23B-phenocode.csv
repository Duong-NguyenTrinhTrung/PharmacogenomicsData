The general definition of a pack year is the number of cigarettes smoked per day, divided by twenty, multiplied by the number of years of smoking. The number of years of smoking is calculated by substracting the age of starting smoking from the age smoking was stopped.   Number of cigarettes per day / 20 * (Age stopped smoking - Age start smoking)  The figure is adjusted for individuals who gave up smoking for more than 6 months, according to data fields 2907 or 3486 by subtracting six months from the number of years of smoking.  Number of cigarettes per day / 20 * (Age stopped smoking - Age start smoking - 0.5)  Note: Individuals who started and gave up smoking before 16 years of age were coded as NA. For individuals who started smoking before 16 but gave up after 16, their age start was set as 16.
